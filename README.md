# Socket connection with JAVA

## Installation

Instal JAVA 

Compile both .java files
```cmd
javac JAVA_FILE.java
```

## Usage

Run the server side first
```cmd

```

Run the client specifying the address and port (localhost and 8000 are hardcoded)
```cmd
java ClientJavaCompiled localhost 8000
```

The aplication should be working.
